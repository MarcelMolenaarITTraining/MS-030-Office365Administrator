# Module 10 - Lab 10 - Exercise 1 - Configuring Yammer Enterprise

Because Yammer Enterprise brings the rich social experiences of Yammer to Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and other Microsoft 365 apps, Holly Dickson is interested in implementing Microsoft Yammer in Adatum's Microsoft 365 pilot project. This will enable Adatum users to share, create, and edit files directly from Yammer conversations with Office for the web.

In this exercise Holly will configure the Yammer organizational settings for Adatum. She will also configure Yammer to enforce Microsoft 365 identity, which enables single sign-on (SSO) capabilities in Yammer. Holly will complete her Yammer preparation by configuring the Yammer user experience. 

### Task 1 - Configure a Yammer organization setting

### Task 3 - Using Yammer

In this task, you will log into Yammer as Nestor Wilke and verify that you receive the Acceptable Use Policy statement that Holly configured in the earlier task.

1. Switch to **LON-CL2**. The last time you used LON-CL2, you were logged into Outlook on the web as the MOD Administrator. You were then instructed to log out of Outlook and close your Edge browsing session at the end of the lab. If your Edge browser is still open, then close it now. 

2. Select the **Microsoft Edge** icon on the taskbar to open a new Edge browsing session, and then enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com**.

In the **Pick an account** window, if Nestor Wilke's **NestorW@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** account appears in the list, then select it now; otherwise, select **Use another account**, sign in as **NestorW@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is the tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider), and enter (or copy and paste in) the tenant admin password provided by your lab hosting provider. 

4. On the **Microsoft Office Home** page, select **Yammer**.

5. If a **Welcome to the new Yammer!** window appears, then close it.

6. A **M365x Acceptable Use Policy** dialog box should appear that displays the Welcome message that Holly configured in the earlier task. Select **I accept**. <br/>

	You have now verified that a user who is signing into Yammer for the first time receives the Acceptable Use Policy statment. If Nestor were to sign out of Yammer and then sign back in, the **M365x Acceptable Use Policy** dialog box would not appear, since he already accepted it. 


**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have enabled Yammer Enterprise for ADatum Corporation.
