# Module 7 - Lab 7 - Exercise 3 - Configuring client access policies

Outlook on the web enables Adatum's users to access their mailboxes through a web browser. After Adatum created its Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online, the tenant included a single Outlook Web App policy titled OWAMailboxPolicy-Default. This policy defines Outlook on the web settings for all users. However, Holly Dickson, Adatum's Enterprise Admin, wants to create an additional Outlook on the web policy that applies to a specific user (in this case, Patti Fernandez). By verifying whether a user-specific policy such as this works, Holly will be able to vary the Outlook on the web settings for users with different needs.

Holly will then configure a mailbox policy for mobile devices that requires a password and sets the parameter for password length. Holly will then create a mobile device access policy that places any new devices into quarantine, at which point the device must be approved to be removed from quarantine so that it can send and receive messages. 

## Task 1: Configure an Outlook Web App policy

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**. 

2. Your Edge browser should be open from the prior exercise, with tabs open for the **Microsoft Office Home** page, the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, and the **Exchange admin center**. You should still be signed into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson. <br/>

	If you closed the Exchange admin center tab after the prior lab exercise, then in the **Microsoft 365 Admin center**, under **Admin Centers** in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Exchange**.

3. In the **Exchange admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **permissions**.

4. On the **permissions** page, the **admin roles** tab at the top of the page is displayed by default. Select the **Outlook Web App policies** tab.

5. On the the **Outlook Web App policies** tab, note the existing Outlook Web App policy titled **OWAMailboxPolicy-Default**. This policy defines Outlook on the web settings for all users. <br/>

	Since Holly wants to add a new policy, select the **plus (+) sign** icon on the menu bar. 

6. In the **new Outlook Web App mailbox policy** window, enter **Limited features** in the **Policy name** field. Note - This policy is titled **Limited features** since it reduces the number of features that will be enabled for the policy.

7. The window displays a list of features that will be enabled for this Outlook Web App mailbox policy. The majority of these features are selected by default. Clear the check boxes for the following features that Holly does not want included in this custom policy:

	- **Instant messaging**

	- **Text messaging**

	- **Unified messaging**

	- **LinkedIn contact sync**

	- **Journaling**

8. At the bottom of the window, under **Private computer or OWA for devices**, clear the **Direct file access** check box, select **Save**, and then select **OK** once the information has been successfully saved.

9. In the **Exchange admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **recipients**.

10. On the **recipients** page, the **mailboxes** tab at the top of the page is displayed by default. In the list of user mailboxes, select **Patti Fernandez** and then select the **pencil (Edit)** icon on the menu bar.

11. In the **Patti Fernandez** window, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **mailbox features**. <br/>

16. By default Outlook should open for the tenant admin account (the MOD Administrator, whose email address is admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com). However, if you are instead prompted for user credentials in a **Windows Security** dialog box, enter **admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is the tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider), and enter the tenant admin password provided by your lab hosting provider.

	To do so, select the MOD Administrator's user icon (the circle with the **MA** initials) in the upper right corner of the screen, then select **Sign out** in the **My account** window, enter **https://outlook.office365.com** in the address bar, sign in as Patti Fernandez (**PattiF@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, where ZZZZZZ is the tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider), and enter the password assigned to the tenant admin account by your lab hosting provider.

26. In Patti's **Inbox**, select the email that you just sent from the **MOD Administrator** that contains the **Attachment Test** subject.

27. Select the **dism.log** message attachment.

28. A message should appear indicating that you do not have permission to download files. <br/>

	**Note:** In some cases, it may take a few minutes for the new Outlook Web App mailbox policy to take effect, so you may not see this message at this time.
