# Module 12 - Lab 12 - Exercise 1 - Monitoring Microsoft 365 Service Health 

As Holly Dickson concludes her Microsoft 365 pilot project, she is interested in viewing the health of Adatum's Microsoft services, including Office on the web, Yammer, and mobile device management cloud services. After doing a little research, Holly has discovered that this information is available on the Service health page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Therefore, if Adataum experiences problems with a cloud service, Holly can check its service health to determine whether this is a known issue with a resolution in progress before she calls Microsoft Support or spends time troubleshooting.

In this exercise, Holly will view the Microsoft 365 service health and several service health reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

### Task 1- View Microsoft 365 service health

1. On **LON-CL1** you should still be logged in as the **Administrator** from the prior lab exercise. 

2. In your Edge browser, you should still have a tab open for the **Microsoft Office Home** page and the **Microsoft 365 admin center** and you should still be logged in as Holly Dickson.
 
3. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Show all**, select **Health**, and then select **Service health**. 

4. On the **Service health** page, in the list of services, the **Exchange Online** service displays 1 incident in the **Status** column. Select this **1 incident**.

5. This displays the **Incidents** tab on the **Service health** page. In the list of incidents, it only displays this one incident related to Exchange Online. Select the title for this incident. This opens an information pane on the right side of the screen that provides details on this incident. Review this information, then close this incident pane.

6. On the **Service health** page, select **All services** on the menu bar.

7. On the **Service health** page, in the list of services, the **Microsoft 365 suite** service displays 2 advisories in the **Status** column. Select this **2 advisories**.

8. This displays the **Advisories** tab on the **Service health** page. In the list of advisories, it only displays these two advisories related to Microsoft 365. Select the title for the first advisory. This opens an information pane on the right side of the screen that provides details on this advisory. Review this information, then close this incident pane. Repeat this for the second advisory.

9. On the **Service health** page, select **History** on the menu bar. This displays a history of incidents and advisories that have been resolved.

10. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane under **Health**, select **Message center**. 

11. The **Message Center** page displays a list of all active messages related to  planned changes. Select a message to open a detail pane that provides a high-level overview of the planed change. Review any of the messages that interest you. 

12. Select any entry in the list to view the details about it. Close the detail pane to return to the history list. Repeat this for any event that interests you.

13. Leave the Edge browser and all its tabs open and proceed to the next task.

### Task 2 -  View reports in the Microsoft 365  admin center

1. On **LON-CL1** you should still be logged in as the **Administrator** from the prior lab exercise. In your Edge browser, you should also be logged into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.

2. In the **Microsoft 365  admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Reports**. Note that as of this writing there are only 3 reports listed in this group. Select each of the reports to view information related to it.

3. Microsoft 365 includes a variety of additional reports, which can be found in the portals to which they apply. For example: <br/>

	- **Security reports** are included in the Reports dashboard in the Security and Compliance Center. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, under the **Admin centers** group, select **Security**. This opens the **Security and Compliance Center**. In the navigation pane under **Reports**, select **Dashbaoard**.
	- **Auditing reports** are included in the Exchange admin center. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, under the **Admin centers** group, select **Exchange**. This opens the **Exchange admin center**. In the navigation pane select **Compliance management**, and then on the **Compliance management** page, select the **auditing** tab.

	Review any of the reports that are of interest to you. <br/>

	**Note:** Most of the reports have limited data due to the lack of data in your virtualized lab environment for the fictitious Adatum Corporation. 

4. Leave the Edge browser open, and leave the **Microsoft Office Home** tab open as well as the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab. However, close all other tabs and then proceed to the next task.


**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have monitored the health of Microsoft 365  services and viewed reports in the Microsoft 365  admin center.
